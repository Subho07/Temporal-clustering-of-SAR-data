# Scattering type parameter extraction and a novel clustering scheme for full and compact polarimetric SAR data



To run the code the coherency matrix elements (T) for FP and covariance matrix elements (C) for CP are required.

N. B. (for NM3CF and NM3CC).

1. The T and C matrix elements should be exported in PolSARpro format and the T3 or C2 directory should contain a "config.txt" file as generated by PolSARpro
2. Please specify the window size for processing

In addition to this for CP decomposition (NM3CC):

1. Please specify the Chi value for processing: for right circular transmit it is -45 and for left circular transmit it is +45
2. Please specify the Psi for processing: for CP it is 0
